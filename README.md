## Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to get the project running on your local machine.

### 1. Prerequisites

-   Python 3.11+
-   A [Google Gemini API Key](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)

### 2. Get Your API Key

1.  Go to **[Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)**.
2.  Sign in and click "**Create API key in new project**".
3.  Copy the generated key.

### 3. Clone the Project

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/yt-summarizer.git
cd yt-summarizer
```

### 4. Set Up the Environment

Using a virtual environment is strongly recommended to keep project dependencies isolated.

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate the environment
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 5. Install Dependencies

Install the required Python packages using pip.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 6. Configure Your API Key

Create a `.env` file in the root of the project. This file will hold your secret API key.

```
GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
```

Replace `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` with the key you obtained from Google AI Studio. The app is configured to load this key automatically.

### 7. Run the Application

Once everything is set up, you can start the Flask server.

```bash
python app.py
```

The application will be running at **http://122.0.0.1:5000**. Open this URL in your browser to use the app.
